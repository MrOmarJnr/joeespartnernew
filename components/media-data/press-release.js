(NGIC)</a>. This collaboration aims to deliver affordable 5G mobile broadband services across Ghana. The Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) has been awarded 5G license and expected to launch 5G services across Ghana within the next six months, followed by expansion to other parts of Africa.</p><p>Next-Gen Infrastructure Company (NGIC) will be the first 5G Mobile Broadband Shared Infrastructure Entity to build a nationwide 4G/ 5G network . The company will also work with MNO partners to launch affordable 4G / 5G-enabled FWA CPEs and smart phones in Ghana within this calendar year. The partnership aims to enhance the lives of Ghanaians by introducing digital services in education, healthcare, and digital payment transactions through P2P (peer-to-peer), P2M (peer-to-merchant) and M2M (merchant-to-merchant) systems , thereby reducing-digital divide and promoting financial inclusion. Additionally, the multiplayer partnership will support NGIC in the entire deployment of network infrastructure and associated services, as communications service providers (CSPs) are looking to address enterprise and consumer markets with enhanced digital services. To achieve this, Tech Mahindra will build a Cloud Native Core Network powered by leading OEM (original equipment manufacturer) platforms.</p><p>NGIC plans to adopt India&rsquo;s successful model of affordable handsets, digital platforms, and localized content and applications. The goal is to replicate this high-speed mobile data model across Africa, beginning with Ghana.</p><p>Mrs. Ursula Owusu-Ekuful, Minister for Communications and Digitalization for the Republic of Ghana, said,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;The creation of a shared 5G Mobile Broadband Infrastructure is critical for delivering affordable, high-speed data access to the people of Ghana and help achieve our Digital Ghana vision. The creation of NGIC as a neutral, shared platform, accessible to all mobile network operators and tower companies, will help to expand 5G services rapidly across the country. We are inspired by India&rsquo;s digital infrastructure and low-cost mobile data usage and keen to replicate it in Ghana.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Mrs. Amina Maina, Director and Chairman for NGIC, said,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;The vision of NGIC is to craft a comprehensive digitization roadmap, placing emphasis on agriculture, education, M-commerce, and healthcare sectors. This collaborative effort, uniting world-leading telecom and technology partners is geared towards enriching the lives of Ghanaians by introducing digital services in education and healthcare. Additionally, we aim to facilitate digital payment transactions via P2P (peer-to-peer), P2M (peer-to-merchant), and M2M (merchant-to-merchant) channels. Our overarching objective is to narrow the digital gap and achieve complete financial inclusion, paving the way for a 100% Digital Ghana.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Richard Hlomador, CEO of K-NET Ltd. and Director and Vice President of NGIC, said,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Thank you for joining us today. First, let&rsquo;s applaud our Minister and the team for organizing this event. While we see this project as telecom infrastructure addressing the telecom deficit and promoting financial inclusion, its true impact lies in creating jobs, enhancing efficiency, improving business operations, and boosting our GDP. This is an opportunity for the youth to leverage this infrastructure for innovation, application development, and digital training.<br/><br/> This project is comparable to discovering a significant oil well—its benefits will extend beyond Ghana to all of Africa. I&rsquo;m proud to be Ghanaian and excited about the immense potential this shared infrastructure holds. We&rsquo;ve seen similar successes in India, and with our experience in building shared infrastructure, we can achieve the same here. Thank you for coming..&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Harkirit Singh, CEO, Ascend Digital and Executive Director, NGIC, said,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;NGIC intends to launch its wholesale 4G/ 5G Network-as-a-Service and make it available to all mobile network operators within the next six months.

We intend to gradually expand to other parts of Africa as well. We will tap the capital markets and bring in strategic investors as and when required.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Mikko Lavanti, Senior Vice President, Middle East and Africa at Nokia, said,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Ghana holds immense potential for mobile broadband growth on the back of an unmet demand for connectivity. Establishing an Open Access Network like NGIC will foster innovation and create numerous opportunities across various sectors. We are proud of our partnership with NGIC in helping Ghana realize its digital vision and unlock its full potential.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Arun Bhikshesvaran, CEO, Radisys, said,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Connectivity for all, through the use of open and disaggregated multi-access solutions, is a key component of Radisys’ initiatives to bridge the digital divide. By bringing Fixed Wireless Access alongside 4G and 5G cellular services to help drive economic growth and digital inclusion, Radisys looks forward to helping Ascend and NGIC build a disruptive and affordable shared broadband infrastructure across Ghana. In addition, our communications platform and digital applications will help create new digital experiences that empower the Ghanian community and foster sustainable and inclusive development.&rdquo;</blockquote><p>Manish Mangal, Chief Technology Officer, Telecom & Global Business Head, Network Services, Tech Mahindra, said,</p><blockquote>&ldquo;Our partnership with Next Gen Infra Co. is based on a shared vision for digital connectivity and providing Network-as-a-Service to innovate and bring cost efficiency to the telecom market in Ghana and Africa.
